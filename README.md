## Semantic versioning :mage:

This project is going to utilize semantic versioning for it tagging.
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
- **Additional** labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
